## 8.0.0

Introduction of Mapbox GL style specification v8. To migrate a v7 style to v8,
use the gl-style-migrate script as described in the README.

* [BREAKING] The value of the `text-font` property is now an array of
  strings, rather than a single comma separated string.
* [BREAKING] Renamed `symbol-min-distance` to `symbol-spacing`.
* [BREAKING] Renamed `background-image` to `background-pattern`.
* [BREAKING] Renamed `line-image` to `line-pattern`.
* [BREAKING] Renamed `fill-image` to `fill-pattern`.
* [BREAKING] Renamed the `url` property of the video source type to `urls`.
* [BREAKING] Coordinates in video sources are now specified in [lon, lat] order.
* [BREAKING] Removed `text-max-size` and `icon-max-size` properties; these
  are now calculated automatically.
* [BREAKING] Constants are no longer supported. If you are editing styles by
  hand and want to use constants, you can use a preprocessing step with a tool
  like [ScreeSS](https://github.com/screee/screess).
* [BREAKING] The format for `mapbox://` glyphs URLs has changed; you should
  now use `mapbox://fonts/mapbox/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`.
* [BREAKING] Reversed the priority of layers for calculating label placement:
  labels for layers that appear later in the style now have priority over earlier
  layers.
* Added a new `image` source type.
* Added a new `circle` layer type.
* Default map center location can now be set in the style.
* Added `mapbox://` sprite URLs `mapbox://sprite/{user | "mapbox"}/{id}`
